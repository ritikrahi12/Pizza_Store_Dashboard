# Pizza_Store_Dashboard
This project is based on a dummy dataset created for learning purposes. The dataset contains fields such as name, gender, and age, which were taken directly. To generate random values for the "quantity" field, I used Excel functions. For calculating the "final amount," I utilized DAX queries in Power BI.

Objective
The primary goal of this project was to enhance my learning and practice skills in data analysis and visualization. While the dataset may not be entirely realistic, it served its purpose for experimentation and skill-building.

Tools and Techniques
SQL:

Used for data cleaning and transformation.
Applied aggregate functions to calculate key metrics like total revenue and total sales.
Practiced advanced SQL queries, particularly focusing on joins.
Excel:

Leveraged Excel functions to generate random values for certain fields.
Power BI:

Designed an interactive dashboard for data visualization.
Used DAX queries for calculations like the final amount.
Key Learnings
Gained hands-on experience with advanced SQL queries, particularly joins.
Improved skills in data visualization and dashboard creation using Power BI.
Understood the process of transforming raw data into meaningful insights.
Future Scope
This project can be further enhanced by using a real-life dataset for more realistic and practical applications. The current approach provides a solid foundation for learning advanced data analytics techniques.
